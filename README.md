# The Toontown Texture Restoration Project

The project, including this readme, is tentative and still under development. Further explanation and elaboration is soon to come. 

## About
The Toontown Texture Restoration Project is a project aimed to implement the released higher quality Toontown textures into a texture pack. This project was initially planned out by various Toontown projects, including [Toontown Offline](https://ttoffline.com), [Toontown: Corporate Clash](https://corporateclash.net), [Tooniversal Studios](https://tooniversal.com), [Operation: Dessert Storm](https://opdessertstorm.com), and [Toontown Frenchy](https://toontownfrenchy.fr).
You can read more in detail from the [latest post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Toontown/comments/hpnoqj/the_first_release_of_the_source_quality_toontown/) and the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Toontown/comments/h0zmdo/psa_in_regards_to_getting_the_toontown_online_hd/) in regards to project direction. (Both posts are curated by Poppy Cheezycorn!)

### Building Phase Files
If you would like to build the folders into up-to-date multifiles, there is a batch file (``BuildFiles.bat``) that can automate the building process*
If you are on Mac use BuildFiles.command to automate the building process. If you are on linux use BuildFiles.sh to automate the building process.

** You will need to have Panda3D installed for this to work!

### Version Differences
The default branch of this repo, ``master``, is aimed to preserve as much of the *original* quality of Pandora assets as possible. That being said, while it's possible to further upscale pandora textures into even higher resolutions, artificial upscaling != original assets.

There are also other limitations across different Toontown projects such as Toontown Rewritten, in which original textures are repalletized and/or renamed. In addition to this, Toontown Rewritten's engine is set to only draw up to a certain maximum resolution of 512x512 for each texture.

To mitigate both of these concerns, two seperate branches have been created for reasons stated above. When most of the textures are game-ready or near completion, official 'releases' will additonally provide an option for each different version (branch) of the project.

## Contributing

Anybody can contribute to this repository until the project is complete! There are literally hundreds of different palettes that need to be worked on.

### What can I do?

 * To get started, find a folder labeled ``!PAL_ME`` within a phase. If there isn't one, that means the entire phase is complete or unstarted with the re-palletization process. There should be even more folders (or files) within the ``!PAL_ME`` folder; one for each palette sheet. From there, you will need to open up that palette in Photoshop (or GIMP) and begin converting.
 
 * If you want to make smaller contributions to this project, there are other areas that can use YOUR help!
  * If a phase does not have a ``!PAL_ME`` folder already (given it's not finished yet), create one! Then, locate that same phase in a typical resources directory *(The phase files of the Toontown Online source (2013), Toontown Rewritten, and Toontown Offline work, as long as the palette wasn't modified from the original.)* and copy all the palletes you see there, including any associated rgb files.)
  * If a ``!PAL_ME`` folder contains textures that aren't in a subfolder, make one for each and put them in their own accordingly! 
  * If the name of any subfolder within ``!PAL_ME`` doesn't match the name of the pallete inside, rename it! (Example: Renaming "New Folder" to "makeatoon_palette_4amla_5")
  * If there's any sort of grammatical issue or any other mechanical errors in the written documentation (including this readme), feel free to correct and modify any as needed!

### Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this repository are done via **pull requests.** You will need to fork this repository on your own account and work from there.

#### Pull Request Process

*There is a fairly strict process on how contributions get accepted. Please read thoroughly!* 

* a) The pull request **MUST** contain the project file of the palettes that were worked on.
**The only project file types that are currently accepted are .psd, .psb, and .xcf** (Photoshop & GIMP project files) 
  * You will need to place your project file under the respected "phase" folder under ``!PROJECT_FILES``. If the phase folder is missing, you may create a new folder and place the project file there.

  * If you are contributing singular assets *to be used for a palette*, you do **not** need to create a project file for the assets.

* b) Palettes that have a corresponding alpha file (``_a.rgb``) should include rather:
   * The jpg and a newly created _a.rgb for the provided palette.
   * A PNG version of the palette with transparency. The process of converting the palette into a proper JPG + RGB combo can be done through a different pull request. When creating a PNG version of the pallete in question, please try and do it from your lossless project files. Unlike JPG, PNG allows for keeping the full quality of an asset, alongside allowing for transparency without an RGB file. Take advantage of it, when you can.

* c) Palette dimensions should be in the power of two. It is also  advised to *upscale first* before placing down any assets. For example, if you are working on a palette of an initial resolution of 128x128, it's recommended to resize textures to powers of 2. A 4x scale from 128x128, to 512x512, should suffice in most cases, but, if the pallete is bigger, upscale to whatever resolution you need, for the texture to fit into the pallete. When upscaling, it is strongly recommended to use Nearest Neighbor Upscaling, for Bilinear upscaling will result in a in a blurrier texture, potentially losing detail. In addition, the highest resolution that will be accepted for a texture is **1024x1024**.

* d) **Please read carefully if you are using Photoshop:** It is __STRONGLY__ recommended to have individual assets imported as *smart objects* before resizing them in the palette. Typically Photoshop automatically does this if you are dragging and dropping them into the canvas, but does not do it automatically if you were to copy and paste the asset onto the canvas itself.

* e) Triple check your export settings to ensure that you are exporting at **100% quality** (especially for JPEGs)

* f) Palettes or textures that are project-exclusive or artificially manipulated go into branches **designated** for these type of contributions. Currently, we are accepting
  * Pull requests for assets aimed for Toontown Rewritten compatibility will only be accepted if merging into the ``Rewritten-Compatibility`` branch.
  * Pull requests for artificially modified textures, such as Waifu2x or any other AI/ML-based upscaling process, will only be accepted if merging into the ``AI-Enhancements`` branch. 

After sending a pull request, a reviewer will check over and verify that the pull request follows all of the guidelines from above.
