phase_4:
- These are stray files
- Technically speaking, the tt_m_int_snowmanHeads could replace the tt_t_efx_snowmanHeads
- However, they're shaded differently, so I did not merge those

- These can be taken from Spotify, problem is that it's being stretched so much that I don't know what to do with it.


phase_6:

- These are missing from the palettes (stray files, RGB ones are most likely irrelevant)

-
qbox.jpg is in a palette instead of being a separate texture
(goofy_speedway_palette_3cmla_1.jpg
   - by the way, this also contains a texture from goofy_speedway_palette_2tmla_1.jpg )


phase_7:
- column.jpg missing from suit_interior_palette_3cmla_2.jpg , ruins order


phase_9:
- Remove RadioBox_map.jpg from palette and recalculate, bet it would work
